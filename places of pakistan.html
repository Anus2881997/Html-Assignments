        Lahore is the second largest city of Pakistan and the provincial capital of the Punjab. Historically, it is
        believed to be about 2000 years old. In ancient times, it was an outpost of Kangra hill Kingdoms and was a
        cut-off township on the trade route to Delhi and A It had hardly any reputation in the Pre-Muslim era. Lahore
        came to eminence with Islam in South Asia.Lahore touched the peak of glory during the rule of the Mughals. The
        Mughal emperors beautified the city with some of the finest architectural buildings and gardens that have
        survived the hazards of time. It was this reputation of Lahore that fascinated the English poet John Milton who
        wrote in 1670: "Agra and Lahore, the Seat of great Mughal." In earlier 17th century, Lahore was the pole-star
        and trend-setter for all the cities of the Empire. In mid 17th century, there were more than ten thousand
        schools in the city.

        <h2><ins>PESHAWAR</h2>
        <img src="../Desktop/images/peshawar.jpg" alt="Peshawar City" width="400" height="300">
        <div>
            Peshawar is one of the oldest cities in Asia and is the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Pashto being
            spoken in and around the city so if you happen to visit you might have quite an edge if you know a little
            Pashto. Peshawar is the administrative center for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan.
            Pushkalavati (now known by the name of Charsadda) was the previous capital of NWFP and the Kushan King
            Kanishka changed the capital from it to Purushapura (now know as Peshawar) in the 2nd century. The name
            Peshawar has been derived from the Sanskrit word meaning “City of Men”. The area basically belonged to the
            Gandhara and eastern Iranian tribes. For a brief period of time it also saw Greek dominance after which the
            Arab conquest took place and Islam came to the rise. .It has moderate climate and its production of silks,
            handicrafts; cotton textile, footwear etc provide a stable economy. Not only does it serve as a link between
            Pakistan and Afghanistan benefiting trade but it is rich in history and culture which makes it a favorite
            hometown for most of its people.Peshawar is a colorful city and if you are coming from a city like Lahore
            you might even find the roads emptier and the surroundings cleaner. It is a place that gives a feeling of
            warmth and nostalgia even to a new visitor. There are historical places like Qisa khuwani bazaar, Fort Bala
            Hisar, Gor Khatri, Namak Mandi which must not be missed as well as some modern buildings.On the contrary
            Peshawar is not very secure like many other cities of our country now, due to kidnappings and ransom cases
            and the bombings. People are advised to come home early and the markets also shut down early and the roads
            less crowded. Which is why it is common to have guns handy in the house but then again it depends on the
            area.

            <img src="../Desktop/Islamabad" alt="islamabad city"> I think it is a place where a person can find the ultimate peace.
            Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan for that reason it has a lot security. I had the chance of living in
            Islamabad for 2 years. Islamabad is a city which was made on mountains so it is a steep area. You would
            actually amazed by the kind of discipline which is ingrained in to the people living in Islamabad. Most
            people regard Islamabad as the place which helps them become a healthier human being as most people over
            there sleep early and wake up early in the morning.
