        Saylani Mass IT Training Program. To Train 10 Thousand Developers in Pakistan

        Living in an era driven by information technology makes investing in our youth through computer programing
        education necessary. Our vision is to make Pakistan a Global Software Development Hub with the brightest IT
        minds. We want to empower our youth to think, create and change the software world. To achieve this goal,
        Saylani launched its Saylani Mass I.T (SMIT) Program. SMIT offers expert training in the areas of Mobile and web
        application development, CCNA, graphic designing, computer based accountancy etc. With about 4,000 students
        currently enrolled with SMIT at Karachi and Faisalabad, we aim to produce a total of 10,000 skilled software
        developers on a national level. Not only will this generate numerous jobs but will also inadvertently boost our
        annual GDP by 1 billion dollars.

        We have collaborated with world-renowned organizations for SMIT that include Microsoft, CISCO, SDC, Viftech and
        City Guild UK.
